95,TOS-1,"Launchers are maintained with chemical troops, but are often employed with artillery. Other applications include defoliation and mine clearing. A variety of enhanced blast mixtures (varying from improvised from common materials to sophisticated) can be used to produce thermobaric or fuel-air explosive (FAE) effects. The sophisticated mix for TOS-1 may be enhanced with powdered tetranite. The primary FAE effect is a long-duration high-pressure blast wave which creates a vacuum - then precipitates a reverse wave. These pressure/vacuum surges (up to 427 pounds per sq inch) cause a ripping effect on soft materials (such as airplane skin, radar surface, human lung tissue). Walls and surfaces within the affected area do not necessarily shield victims, rather causing multiple pressure waves, which amplify the tearing effects and can topple structures. A secondary effect is high-temperature heat - 2,500-3,000° C. An incomplete explosion renders a near-devastating effect, wide-area long-duration high-temperature flame. Even those outside of the blast area will be rendered ineffective with debilitating mental and physical trauma. Primary TOS-1 use considerations are: (1) it works best under conditions which normally protect targets from weapons: (2) it has a high assurance of devastation within a large area. The TOS-1 is designed primarily for use against emplacements, defilade areas (such as terrain folds and tunnels), fighting positions, ships, buildings, as well as personnel and other soft targets. High angles-of-fire and steep impact angles support use in defilade and urban areas.
