44,J-7; Fishbed,"The soviets licensed the manufacture of the mig-21f and its engine to china in 1961, and assembly of the first j-7 using chinese-made components began early 1964. The j-7 aircraft was the most widely produced chinese fighter, replacing older j-6 fighters, the chinese version of the mig-19. In 1995 it was projected that j-7 production would continue for at least another decade, resulting in a total inventory of nearly 1000 aircraft by 2005, but the plaaf inventory has remained at about 500 aircraft, suggesting that production was either suspended or terminated. Appearance: wings: mid-mount, delta, clipped tip, engines: one turbofan in fuselage, fuselage: circular with dorsal spine, tail: swept-tail with large vertical surfaces and ventral fin variants: j-7 I/f-7: initial production version, similar to mig-21f fishbed-c.

45,J-8; Finback,"The best that can be said for the j-8 is that once upgraded it will be no more than an advanced obsolete aircraft, comparable in configuration and aerodynamic performance to the su-15/flagon. The j-8 and j-8-ii aircraft are trouble-prone aircraft with a poor weapon suite and an inefficient engine. At best, the j-8-ii can be compared with an early model (1960s) us f-4 phantom. In fact, after twenty-six years the j-8-ii is still in the development stage, has resulted in only about 100 fighters deployed, and meets none of the requirements of the plan. Appearance: wings: sharply set delta wing, engines: side by side w open turbojets, fuselage: slender with nose engine air intake (j-8-I), solid conical nose (j-8-ii), tail: swept with full-height rudder.
