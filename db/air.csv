Following their languages, in Germany it is known as the Tiger; in France and Spain it is called the Tigre. Development of the Tiger started during the Cold War, and it was initially intended as an anti-tank helicopter platform to be used against a Soviet ground invasion of Western Europe. During its prolonged development period the Soviet Union collapsed, but France and Germany chose to proceed with the Tiger, developing it instead as a multirole attack helicopter. It achieved operational readiness in 2008. The Tiger has the distinction of being the first all-composite helicopter developed in Europe; even the earliest models also incorporate other advanced features such as a glass cockpit, stealth technology, and high agility to increase its survivability. Improved variants have since entered service, outfitted with more powerful engines and compatible with a wider range of weapons.

63,TU-22M3; Backfire-C,"The backfire is a long-range aircraft capable of performing nuclear and conventional attack, anti-ship, and reconnaissance missions. Its low-level penetration features make it a much more survivable system than its predecessors. Carrying either bombs or as-4/kitchen air-to-surface missiles, it is a versatile strike aircraft, believed to be intended for theater attack in europe and asia, but also potentially capable of missions against the united states. The backfire can be equipped with probes for in-flight refueling, which would further increase its range and flexibility.
