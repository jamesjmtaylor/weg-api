In addition to the low radar cross section, the boat is also extremely fast with an aluminum monohull with stepped planning and the catamaran design also provides better seaworthiness in comparison to the other boats of similar displacement with a conventional hull. The missile boats have been successfully exported to Iran, where since 2000 it has been in service with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Navy Corps.

There are ten Zubr-class hovercraft in service. There are two vessels in the Russian Navy and four with the Hellenic Navy.[3] In 2009, China placed an order for four vessels from Ukraine [order transferred to Russia now] as part of a deal worth 315 million USD.[5] Two updated versions of the vessels were built by Crimea's Feodosia Shipbuilding Company, followed by two advanced models of the surface warship.",individual/enlcac,photo/zubr,GSSh-6-30K,SA-N-8 Gremlin,null,null,BMP-2,8,0,55,400,550

The craft races at high speed across open areas with only the cab showing, and reduces speed to approach shore, and the new i-silc can submerge to a depth of approximately 7 meters as it approaches the shore. Similar craft are marketed by a firm located in singapore, and according to news reports, craft similar to the nk silc were delivered to iran. South american drug traffickers have attempted to obtain silcs for use in transporting drugs into the u.S.. Usually launched from ""mother ships"" that are disguised as fishing vessels or freighters. Several versions exist, including at least one that is fully submersible. Although the craft can operate from far bases in shallow coastal waters, most are carried on ""mother ships"". These 50-100 ton ships are operated by naval spf forces and are disguised as large, commercial fishing vessels, not unlike large fishing vessel “mother ships” or freighters which have one or two underwater doors concealed on the stern, to launch semisubmersible craft. Some mother ships are actually intelligence ships, again disguised as large fishing vessels or freighters, with an array of intercept, reconnaissance, and radio systems, as well as semisubmersible craft. A 100-ton trawler was found with sa-16/igla-1 manpads, and rpg-7v atgls. Hovercraft can also be used to launch silcs and i-silcs.",individual/enboat,photo/silc,null,null,null,null,null,0,3,50,300,5
