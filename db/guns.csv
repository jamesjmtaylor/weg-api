5,AK-47,Photo is of an akm. All 7.62x39 mm kalashnikov assault rifles are very dependable weapons. They produce a high volume of fire and are simple to maintain and produce. The primary difference between the ak-47 and the improved akm is the receiver. The receiver of the ak-47 is forged and machined while the receiver of the akm is stamped metal facilitating easier and less costly manufacturing. Both the ak-47 and the akm can mount a 40-mm under-barrel grenade launcher. The ak-47 and akm have been replaced in many armies by the newer ak-74. The ak-74 is basically an akm re-chambered to fire a 5.45x39 mm cartridge.

Although intended primarily for use as an antitank weapon, the m67 can be used against secondary targets such as gun emplacements and bunkers. It is also very effective in an anti-personnel role. Although no longer produced in the us, the m67 is still in production by south korea. The crew consists of a gunner, assistant gunner, and ammo bearer. The m67 can be operated with a crew of only two; however, the third crew member (ammo bearer) is considered necessary for efficient operations. In the absence of an individual to perform the duties assigned to the ammo bearer, the gunner (crew member 1) lays and fires the 90-mm rifle and is the crew leader. He carries the m67 and a pistol. The loader (crew member 2) is responsible for loading the rifle and acts as the gunner when required. He secures ammunition and checks the clearance of the back blast area prior to firing. He carries a pistol, spare parts, cleaning materiel, and 3 rounds of 90-mm. The ammunition bearer (crew member 3) is responsible for securing ammunition and providing security for the recoilless rifle position. He carries an assault rifle and 4 rounds of 90-mm. The m67 has been replaced by the carl gustav m2 and the at4 weapons systems.",group/frat,individual/frinfat,photo/m67,420,350,0

The first model (Mod 0) in 1966 was determined to be unreliable and unsafe, but a total of six Mod 1 launchers were successfully tested on U.S. Navy riverine patrol craft in the Mekong Delta in 1972. The Navy made further improvements to the weapon, resulting in the Mod 3 in 1976. The Mod 3 was adopted by the U.S Army in 1983 and remains in service to the present day.",group/frinf,individual/frhvyagl,photo/mk19,2250,60,0

Missile has a dive or top-attack maneuver for high armor penetration. Lofted flight path permits use against helicopters.

63,Starstreak II,"Ground-based ad system optimized for use against armored helicopters and low flying fixed-wing aircraft. Missile emplys smokeless propellant for minimal dignature. Flight time (5-8 sec) and lbr guidance make it essentially immune to countermeasures. Because of the high velocity, the system exceeds the hit probability of cometing systems agaisnt high-speed aitcraft on receding flight paths. The startstreak's lower cost and capabilities as a mulit-role missile system offers varied uses. Two considerations are the semi-automoatic command line-of-sight (saclos) guidance and contact fuzes which make it less effective agaisnt agile fixed-wing aircraft from some aspects. Thus a more practical course wold be to replace 33-50% of the manpads. With the lower cost of starstreak and its multi-ole capability, it could replace a portion of the expensive single-role manpads with starstreaks, for instance, an 18-manpads battery could be reduced 35%.",group/frat,individual/frltatgm,photo/starstreakii,8000,120,0

It fires by means of an electrical solenoid when the tank is buttoned up and an optical sight inside the cupola is used. Instead of the normal 50-round ammunition belt container, the nsvt on the t-64 may use a larger belt container holding 200 rounds.",group/eninf,individual/enhvymg,photo/nsvt,2000,20,0
