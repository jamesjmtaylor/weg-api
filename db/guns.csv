16,Photo is of an akm. All 7.62x39 mm kalashnikov assault rifles are very dependable weapons. They produce a high volume of fire and are simple to maintain and produce. The primary difference between the ak-47 and the improved akm is the receiver. The receiver of the ak-47 is forged and machined while the receiver of the akm is stamped metal facilitating easier and less costly manufacturing. Both the ak-47 and the akm can mount a 40-mm under-barrel grenade launcher. The ak-47 and akm have been replaced in many armies by the newer ak-74. The ak-74 is basically an akm re-chambered to fire a 5.45x39 mm cartridge. The 7.62x39 mm rpk light machinegun is based on the ak/akm design while the rpk-74 is a light machinegun version of the ak-74. Both are infantry squad level support weapons.,group/eninf.png,individual/enrifle.png,AK-47,6,photo/AK47.jpg,300

They snap together in seconds. Missile upgrade time to malyutka 2 is a few minutes. The guidance panel can be located up to 15 meters from the launcher, and can control up to four launchers. If target is <1,000 meters from launcher, the operator can joystick the missile to target without using optics. Because the module is small and can be shifted, elevation and field of view are operationally unlimited. Improved versions can be used on older launchers, but in the mclos mode.

Many countries use the dshk 38/46 on vehicular mounts while others use it mostly on its ground mount. Many asian counties use a 2-wheel mount in the ground role. The m1938 tripod is used for ground fire but can be readily converted for aa fire. M38 and m46 ammo belts are not interchangeable. A large flat armored shield is occasionally used to protect the crew when the gun is used in its ground role. In many countries this weapon was replaced by the 12.7-mm nsv in the ground role or by the heavier 14.5-mm zpu series in the antiaircraft role.,group/eninf.png,individual/enhvymg.png,DShKM,13,photo/DShKM.jpg,2000

68,"The m67 90-mm recoilless rifle is a lightweight, portable, direct-fire only, crew-served antitank weapon. It is designed to be fired primarily from the ground using the bipod and monopod, but it may be fired from the shoulder. It is an air-cooled, breech-loaded, single-shot rifle that fires fixed ammunition. Although intended primarily for use as an antitank weapon, the m67 can be used against secondary targets such as gun emplacements and bunkers. It is also very effective in an anti-personnel role. Although no longer produced in the us, the m67 is still in production by south korea. The crew consists of a gunner, assistant gunner, and ammo bearer. The m67 can be operated with a crew of only two; however, the third crew member (ammo bearer) is considered necessary for efficient operations. In the absence of an individual to perform the duties assigned to the ammo bearer, the gunner (crew member 1) lays and fires the 90-mm rifle and is the crew leader. He carries the m67 and a pistol. The loader (crew member 2) is responsible for loading the rifle and acts as the gunner when required. He secures ammunition and checks the clearance of the back blast area prior to firing. He carries a pistol, spare parts, cleaning materiel, and 3 rounds of 90-mm. The ammunition bearer (crew member 3) is responsible for securing ammunition and providing security for the recoilless rifle position. He carries an assault rifle and 4 rounds of 90-mm. The m67 has been replaced by the carl gustav m2 and the at4 weapons systems.",group/frat.png,individual/frinfat.png,M67,350,photo/M67.jpg,420

72,"The Mk 19 grenade launcher (pronounced Mark 19) is an American 40 mm belt-fed automatic grenade launcher that was first developed during the Vietnam War. The first model (Mod 0) in 1966 was determined to be unreliable and unsafe, but a total of six Mod 1 launchers were successfully tested on U.S. Navy riverine patrol craft in the Mekong Delta in 1972. The Navy made further improvements to the weapon, resulting in the Mod 3 in 1976. The Mod 3 was adopted by the U.S Army in 1983 and remains in service to the present day.",group/frinf.png,individual/frhvyagl.png,Mk 19,60,photo/Mk19.jpg,2250

74,"Ground-based ad system optimized for use against armored helicopters and low flying fixed-wing aircraft. Missile emplys smokeless propellant for minimal dignature. Flight time (5-8 sec) and lbr guidance make it essentially immune to countermeasures. Because of the high velocity, the system exceeds the hit probability of cometing systems agaisnt high-speed aitcraft on receding flight paths. The startstreak's lower cost and capabilities as a mulit-role missile system offers varied uses. Two considerations are the semi-automoatic command line-of-sight (saclos) guidance and contact fuzes which make it less effective agaisnt agile fixed-wing aircraft from some aspects. Thus a more practical course wold be to replace 33-50% of the manpads. With the lower cost of starstreak and its multi-ole capability, it could replace a portion of the expensive single-role manpads with starstreaks, for instance, an 18-manpads battery could be reduced 35%.",group/frat.png,individual/frltatgm.png,Starstreak II,120,photo/StarstreakII.jpg,8000

On the t-72/t-80 mount he engages ground targets with metallic sights on the gun itself. The t-64 tank mounts a modified version with a fixed mount on the commander’s cupola. It fires by means of an electrical solenoid when the tank is buttoned up and an optical sight inside the cupola is used. Instead of the normal 50-round ammunition belt container, the nsvt on the t-64 may use a larger belt container holding 200 rounds.",group/eninf.png,individual/enhvymg.png,NSVT,20,photo/NSVT.jpg,2000
